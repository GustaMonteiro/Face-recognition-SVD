# Face recognition using SVD
This repository contains a project for my Linear Algebra course in Computer Science program in **Ceara's State University (Universidade Estadual do Cear√° - UECE)**.
The project consists in use **Singular Value Decomposition** to apply a dimensionality reduction and classificate images of **Extended Yale-B database**. My team and I reached a **77.24%** of accuracy with aproximately **10%** of data from our **U** matrix from the **SVD**.
This project was made in colaboration with 3 other friends, Emerson Lucena, Arthur David and Yaslim Soares.
